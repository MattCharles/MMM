# MMM

Simple tool to aid in creation of Might, Money and Magic card game (name WIP).

Goal is something to handle discard piles, drawing, adding cards to deck, drawing tiles. We can still handle gameplay manually if need be - which seems likely - but this at least will prevent us from needing to painstakingly maintain lists of cards in our hands manually.
